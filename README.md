My Portfolio - Fullstack Architecture Demo
This is my personal portfolio. While it looks like a simple website, I built it to demonstrate how I handle modern frontend architecture and system performance.

As a developer focused on backend systems and clean code, I wanted a site that wasn't just "pretty," but also fast, modular, and easy to maintain.

🚀 The Tech Stack
React & Vite: For a super-fast development experience and optimized builds.

shadcn/ui: I chose this "copy-paste" component approach so I have full ownership of my code. It’s not a black-box library; I can tweak every pixel.

Tailwind CSS: For clean, utility-first styling.

Framer Motion: To give the site a smooth, "weightless" feel with scroll-based animations.

Lucide React: For consistent, professional iconography.

🛠️ Key Features (The "Backend" Mindset)
Performance First: I configured custom Rollup chunk splitting to make sure the site stays fast, even with heavy components like the calendar.

Meeting Scheduler: Integrated a functional date-picker (using date-fns) into the contact form, ready to handle real-world scheduling data.

Clean Architecture: Everything is organized into "UI Atoms" and "Page Organisms." No messy, giant files here.

Responsive Design: Works perfectly on anything from a large 4K monitor to a small phone.
